# Explaining SWIN Transformer Predictions on Traffic Sign Recognition with Shapley-CAM

## Introduction

Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) is a vital computer vision challenge for autonomous driving systems, requiring accurate identification of signs despite varying environmental conditions and occlusions. SWIN Transformer architecture offers significant advantages for TSR through its ability to capture both local and global image dependencies via hierarchical feature representation and shifted windowing mechanisms. As these sophisticated models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, Shapley-CAM provides essential interpretability by combining Shapley values with Class Activation Mapping techniques, enhancing trust and enabling more effective debugging of these complex vision systems.

## Model Overview
### SWIN Transformer

The Shifted Window (SWIN) Transformer represents a significant advancement in vision transformer architecture by introducing hierarchical representation and shifted windows. SWIN implements a hierarchical structure with varying window sizes across different layers. This design efficiently computes self-attention within local windows while allowing for cross-window connections through the window-shifting mechanism.

SWIN Transformer is particularly well-suited for traffic sign recognition for several compelling reasons:

1. **Multi-scale feature representation**: Traffic signs appear at various scales in real-world scenarios. SWIN's hierarchical design naturally captures features at different resolutions, improving recognition across varying distances and sign sizes.

2. **Context-aware processing**: By combining local attention within windows and connections between windows, SWIN can simultaneously focus on fine details of sign symbols while understanding their context within the broader scene.

3. **Robust to occlusions**: The transformer's attention mechanism helps maintain performance even when signs are partially obscured by other objects, weather conditions, or lighting variations.

### Dataset

#### Description of Dataset
This study utilizes the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB), a well-established dataset for traffic sign classification tasks. The GTSRB contains over 50,000 images of traffic signs spread across 43 different classes, representing various traffic sign categories including speed limits, no entry, yield, and stop signs. The dataset features real-world images captured under diverse conditions, presenting several challenges:

- Varying illumination and weather conditions
- Different viewing angles and distances
- Partial occlusions and physical damage
- Imbalanced class distribution (some sign types appear more frequently than others)
- Resolution variations across samples

The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with approximately 39,209 images for training and 12,630 images for testing. Each image in the dataset is annotated with its corresponding traffic sign class, making it suitable for supervised learning approaches.
