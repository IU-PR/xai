<p><strong>Week #1 is the most crucial week of the entire semester as it sets the foundation for your project</strong>. During this week, your primary tasks are to form your team and select a project. The team formation process should carefully consider the skills, expertise, and compatibility of team members to ensure effective collaboration.</p>
<p>Once your team is formed, it is essential to pitch and discuss project ideas among yourselves. Select a project that aligns with one of the three tiers: web, mobile, or ML (machine learning). The chosen project should be well-defined, feasible, and have a clear problem statement.</p>
<p>Additionally, we expect each team to maintain a weekly progress report blog. These reports are a crucial means of tracking the progress of your projects. Each team is required to submit a report no later than Friday 18:00 of each week. The reports should be informative, substantive, and provide a detailed account of your progress. It is important to clearly explain what you have accomplished, how you have achieved it, and any obstacles or challenges you have encountered.</p>
<p>These weekly reports will be evaluated, and feedback will be provided to assist you in the successful completion of your projects. Therefore, it is crucial to submit your reports on time and ensure they reflect the substantial progress you have made throughout the week.</p>
<p>We encourage you to use this blog as a platform to share your accomplishments, insights, and challenges. It is a valuable opportunity to communicate your ideas, seek feedback, and engage with your peers. By actively participating and sharing your experiences, you contribute to the collaborative learning environment we aim to foster.
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  Remember, the success of your projects depends on your commitment, dedication, and effective teamwork. Embrace this opportunity to showcase your skills, innovate, and create impactful projects. Good luck, and let&rsquo;s make this semester a remarkable journey of growth and accomplishment!

  <strong>Defining the Vision for Your Project</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#defining-the-vision-for-your-project">#</a>
</h2>
<p>A clear and compelling vision is crucial for successful project planning. When you have a well-defined concept and a shared vision of what you aim to achieve, executing on that vision becomes significantly easier. Therefore, after thorough discussions and settling on a promising idea, it is essential to craft a comprehensive vision with your team.
